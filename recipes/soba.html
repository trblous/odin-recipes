    <p> <strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soba noodles:</strong> to be cooked, chilled and served alongside your Tsuyu sauce. These noodles are sold</br>
               pre-portioned and only take 3-4 minutes to cook in boiling water, to be strained and rinsed under
              </br> ice-cold water prior to serving.</br> </br> 
        <li><strong>Dashi:</strong> for the base stock. This is the backbone of many Japanese dishes, and can be prepared easily</br>
        with instant soup stock, which works in a similar fashion as chicken bouillon powder.</br> 
        To prepare your dashi, simply mix the powder into water and it’s ready to go! For 1 cup of water, you</br>
        will need to mix in about 1/2 tsp of dashi powder.</br>
        Please feel free to use homemade stock as well if you prefer, but this method is a true life-saver for</br>
        the busy days, without compromising the flavor.</br>
        Another alternative is to use low-sodium chicken stock, or a 2:1 ratio of regular chicken stock and water.</br>
        To prepare for this recipe, you’ll need to mix 2/3 cup of chicken stock with 1/3 cup water.</li>
    </ol>
