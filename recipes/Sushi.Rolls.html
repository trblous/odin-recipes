    <p>This recipe will teach you how to make some popular sushi rolls like California rolls, Philadelphia rolls,</br> or spicy tuna rolls at home.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sushi rice</li>
        <li>1(4 inch) piece dashi kombu</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon rice wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 nori seaweed sheets</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put rice into a large deep bowl. Fill with cold water and rub rice together with hands until water turns</br>
            milky white. Drain cloudy water, being careful not to pour out rice. Repeat three or four times until you</br>
            can see rice through 3 inches of water; drain once more.</li> </br>
        <li>Transfer rice to a saucepan; add kombu and 3 cups water. Let stand 30 minutes. Cover; bring to a boil over</br>
            high heat. Reduce heat to low; simmer 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 5 minutes.</li> </br>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir together rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl until dissolved.</li> </br>
        <li>Remove and discard kombu; stir in vinegar mixture until no lumps remain. Spread rice mixture onto a rimmed</br>
            9x13 baking sheet. [Spreading helps cool rice and prevents it from continuing to cook.] Let cool to room temperature.</li> </br>
        <li>Lay one sheet of nori on a sushi mat lined with plastic wrap; spread 1 cup of rice over nori with damp</br>
            fingers, leaving a 1-inch border along one edge. Arrange desired fillings (see below) crosswise just off center</br>
            of rice. Carefully lift filled edge of nori and roll over filling toward unfilled edge, tucking as you roll.</br>
            Brush unfilled edge of nori with water; press to seal. Cut each roll into 8 pieces. Repeat with remaining nori,</br>
            rice, and fillings. To make ahead, chill, covered, up to 4 hours.</li>

    </ol>
